Searchme
========

```searchme``` uses the [awalk](https://github.com/TravelGround/awalk) script to search through a root directory, finding any file that is not called at least once.


## Installation

First, you need to install [node](http://nodejs.org). Then you can continue!

This script runs in terminal.

To get these tools running, you need the following dependencies, available off npm:


- [commander](http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js)
- [shelljs](http://shelljs.org)
- [underscorejs](http://underscorejs.org)
- [cli-color](https://npmjs.org/package/cli-color)
- [awalk](https://github.com/TravelGround/awalk)
- [utils](https://github.com/TravelGround/utils)

To install this dependency (the easy way), run the following command from the ``` searchme ``` root dir:

``` $ npm install ```

Or place the dependencies there manually but adding them to a ``` node_modules ``` folder

Or add them individually by calling:

``` $ npm install underscore ```

Lastly make the script executable using ```chmod +x searchme.js```


## Usage

How do you use ``` searchme ```, I hear you asking? Well:

- Open terminal
- Navigate to the ``` awalk ``` root dir
- Type ``` ./searchme ``` and press enter
- There are your helpful instructions :D
